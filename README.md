# Rich Text Editor Toolbar

## Instructions

For this programming challenge you will be implementing a rich text editor toolbar that supports common operations like bolding text or adding links. A good reference for the toolbar's behavior is [Medium's](https:/www.medium.com) toolbar. We've provided some screenshots but we recommend you visit Medium and play around with it.

In this sandbox we've provided you with all the boilerplate necessary for you to get started. It's set up with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), and [Slate](https://docs.slatejs.org/).

## What we're looking for

Our team values strong communication, critical thinking, and intellectual curiosity. We will be reviewing how you organize your code, how you prioritize decisions based on the requirements, and how you can apply your software engineering experience to develop creative solutions that showcase your skills.
